    <p>First you need to know what linux is<p>
    <h1> What is Linux? <h1>
    <p>Linux is an operating system, just like Windows or Mac. It's like the brain of a computer that helps it do things like run programs and store files.  The cool thing about Linux is that it's free and open source, which means anyone can use it and even change its code to make it better. It's like a big community of people working together to create something awesome.  It's also known for being very secure and reliable, so it's used a lot in servers and supercomputers. And even though it might not have as many fancy graphics as other operating systems, it's still very powerful and customizable<p>

    <h1>History of Debian Linux Distrobutions</h1>
    <P>Debian is a free and open-source operating system that forms the basis of many popular Linux distributions. Debian is known for its stability, security and its huge Collection of Apps. Debian is also known for its strong adherence to the Unix philosophy, which emphasizes customization and transparency.</br>
    <p>Debian-based distributions are operating systems that are based on Debian's features. Examples of popular Debian-based distributions include Ubuntu, Linux Mint, and Knoppix. These distributions add custom Menus and Interfaces, Apps, and other enhancements to the Debian system.</br>
    <p>Debian-based distributions are often favored by users for their ease of use and the large collection of apps. Debian's package management system is strong, making it easy for users to install, upgrade, and remove apps. The technique reduces the possibility of software compatibility issues by installing and maintaining packages consistently. Debian-based distributions also provide a stable and secure environment, making them a popular choice for servers and desktops alike.</br>
    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>I chose a Debian based distribution because of its stability, reliability, and flexibility. Debian is one of the oldest and most popular Linux distributions, and it has been around since 1993. It is a free and open source operating system, and it is maintained by a large community of volunteers. Debian is known for its stability, as it is one of the most reliable distributions available. It is also very secure, as it is regularly updated with security patches and bug fixes.</br>
    <p>In addition to its stability and security, Debian is also very flexible. It can be used for a variety of purposes, from playing games to web servers. It is also highly customizable, allowing users to install and configure the software they need. Debian also has a wide range of apps available, making it easy to find the software you need.</br>
    <p>Debian is a great choice for those who are new to Linux. It is easy to install and use, and it has a large community of users who are willing to help out with any questions or problems. It is also a great choice for those who want to learn more about Linux, as it is a great platform for learning</br>
